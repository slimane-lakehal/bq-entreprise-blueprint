# BQ Enterprise Blueprint

> Migrating a fictional French omnichannel retail group from a legacy SQL Server DWH to a modern Google BigQuery data platform — built in public as a portfolio and freelance reference implementation.

---

## Business Context

**Groupe Lumio** operates three retail brands across 60 stores in France plus an e-commerce site, generating roughly €180M in annual revenue. Their data infrastructure hadn't moved in a decade: an on-premises SQL Server data warehouse, SSRS reports that took hours to refresh, and analysts spending their mornings in Excel.

The migration goal is a unified, cloud-native data platform that gives the business:

- A **single source of truth** across POS, ERP, CRM, and web analytics
- **Self-serve analytics** for brand and supply chain teams via Looker Studio
- A **real-time stock visibility** layer across all stores and the warehouse
- An **ML-ready foundation** for demand forecasting and customer segmentation

EU data residency is a hard constraint throughout — all data stays in `europe-west1`.

## Key Technical Decisions

**Infrastructure as Code from day one**
Every GCP resource — datasets, buckets, service accounts, IAM bindings — is declared in Terraform and applied via CI. No click-ops, no undocumented permissions.

**Keyless CI authentication (Workload Identity Federation)**
GitHub Actions authenticates to GCP via OIDC, not a stored JSON key. Short-lived credentials are minted per workflow run. Nothing to rotate, nothing to leak.

**Least-privilege service accounts**
Two dedicated SAs with minimal scope: `lumio-ingestion` (write to GCS + raw datasets) and `lumio-dbt` (read raw, write staging/marts). They cannot touch each other's resources.

**Idempotent pipelines**
Every ingestion script is safe to re-run for the same date — it overwrites the Parquet blob in GCS rather than appending. Every dbt incremental model uses `unique_key`. Running a job twice produces the same result.

**Strict dbt layering**
Staging renames and casts only. Intermediate handles joins and business logic. Marts aggregate. `SELECT *` is banned — every model projects explicit columns. This keeps the DAG understandable as it grows.

**Cost-conscious BigQuery usage**
Every large table is partitioned by date and clustered by its dominant filter key. Queries on partitioned tables must filter on the partition column. Staging models are views; intermediate and mart models are tables or incrementals.

**Simulated sources, real patterns**
The source systems are simulated (Olist dataset for POS, Faker for ERP/CRM, BigQuery public datasets for Shopify/GA4), but the ingestion patterns, data contracts, GCS layout, and dbt models are production-grade. The point is the architecture, not the data.
